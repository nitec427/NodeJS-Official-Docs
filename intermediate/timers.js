// Run a function after some x delay

// setTimeout(function(arg1, arg2, ...) => {

// },2000, arg1, arg2, ...)

// it returns the id of caller
// In case you want to delete you can use this value

// If a long-running task is executed in shorter intervals it is better use recursive setTimeout functions so that when 1 operation is executed another one starts after some delay
